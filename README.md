### Hello!

Minesweeper for Unreal Engine 5. Begin playing by pressing the 3x3 square icon left of the Debug/Play button.

Features:
- Minesweeper Mechanics as expected
- Mine flagging mechanic
- Difficulty dropdown, along with the option to use custom difficulties

This challenge was quite fun! I will private this git repository after a short while since it's on my project feed, and I don't wish to confuse users following my github.

### AI Usage

- There was a single instance of AI usage in this project, and you can find it in the code by simply searching for the string 'LLM'
